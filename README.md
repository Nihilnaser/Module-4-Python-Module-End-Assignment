Project Overview
The objective of this project was to analyze employee data for a Company, covering various aspects such as team distribution, position breakdown, age groups, salary allocation, and correlations. Using Python, we processed and analyzed a dataset of 458 employees across multiple teams, and presented insights and visualizations to inform decision-making.

Step 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing

Data Loading
The dataset was loaded directly from the provided online link using Pandas, which enabled us to access and work with the data efficiently.

Data Validation
After loading the dataset, we verified the data's integrity by:

Checking for Duplicate Entries: We found no duplicate rows in the dataset, indicating that all entries were unique.
Handling Missing Values: We identified missing values in the Salary and College columns. To maintain data consistency and ensure reliable analysis, these missing values were removed before proceeding.

Step 2: Data Analysis and Visualization
The analysis focused on answering specific questions regarding the employee dataset.

Task 1: Team Distribution

Goal: To determine the distribution of employees across different teams and calculate the percentage of each team relative to the total employee count.
Method: We used value_counts() to get the number of employees per team and calculated percentages based on the total dataset size.
Visualization: A bar plot displayed the number of employees per team, helping us easily identify team sizes and distribution.
Task 2: Position Distribution

Goal: To categorize employees by position within the company.
Method: Similar to team distribution, we used value_counts() for the "Position" column to count employees in each position.
Visualization: A bar chart represented the distribution, allowing us to observe which positions had the highest and lowest representation.
Task 3: Age Group Analysis

Goal: To identify the predominant age group among employees.
Method: Using pd.cut(), we created age bins (20-25, 25-30, etc.) and counted the number of employees in each group.
Visualization: A bar plot displayed the distribution of age groups, highlighting the most common age ranges within the workforce.
Task 4: Salary Expenditure by Team and Position

Goal: To find which team and position incur the highest salary expenditures.
Method: We used groupby() on the "Team" and "Position" columns, calculating total salaries for each group.
Visualization: Separate bar plots for team and position expenditures visually emphasized where the most resources were allocated.
Task 5: Correlation Between Age and Salary

Goal: To determine if there is any correlation between employeesâ€™ age and their salary.
Method: A scatter plot visualized the relationship, allowing us to observe any positive or negative trends between age and salary.


Insights
The following insights were derived from our analysis:

Team and Position Distribution: Certain teams and positions have more employees, which may suggest strategic focus areas within the company.
Predominant Age Group: A significant portion of employees falls within the 25-30 age range, which could influence policies around employee benefits and retention.
Salary Allocation: The analysis revealed which teams and positions have the highest salary expenditure, useful for budgeting and resource allocation.
Age-Salary Correlation: The scatter plot provided a view of any potential trends between age and salary, allowing further analysis of compensation patterns across different age groups.

Conclusion
This project showcased effective data handling, preprocessing, and analysis. By correcting missing values, randomizing height data, and visualizing key metrics, we provided Company with valuable insights into its workforce composition. The detailed analysis and visualizations assist in understanding team structures, resource distribution, and workforce demographics.

The results were documented thoroughly, with each step recorded for transparency, and the final project was uploaded to GitHub for further review and feedback.
